If you encounter anything that seems like a bug, please report it.
However I won't investigate on bug reports that do not contain all relevant information.

## How to report bugs

If you encounter a bug within XPlane2Blender please follow these steps to make it easier for the developer(s) to fix it:

1. Check the [issues-list at the GitHub-Project-Page](https://github.com/der-On/XPlane2Blender/issues), to see if your bug has not been reported yet
2. Open up Blender from a terminal/console.
    Under windows you have to launch blender with the Start > "run" command by typing "blender.exe" into it.
    Under Unix (Mac/Linux) you have to open up a terminal and type "blender".
3. Open up the file causing the bug.
4. Repeat the steps causing the bug.
5. Look into the terminal/console and copy the error-message that might have showed up in it. It's best If you copy everything, so the developer gets as much information as possible.
6. [Create a post at x-plane.org](http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?showtopic=47934&page=1) / Or open up an [issue at Github](https://github.com/der-On/XPlane2Blender/issues) containing the following information: Your **Operating System**, your XPlane2Blender version (e.g. 3.20r1), your Blender version together with the **build-number** (if using Blender 2.5x this is the number after the "r"), the **exact steps for reproducing the error**, the **error message(s)**, if possible the file causing the error **cleared of all non-relevant parts for the bug**.
7. Wait and hope. We will look into it and fix it asap.

Please only send me private messages/email to send me the buggy files. Do not send me your bug report in a PM or email. Making the bugs/problems and their solutions public will help all other users of XPlane2Blender with the same problem.


If you think this is a good thing [buy me a beer](./Donations).
